    <!-- SEO title tag section
    The title tag in the head of an HTML page is an important factor for SEO ranking.
    We should try to place the most important keywords into the title tag. The title 
    should be about 55 to 60 characters long. Our goal is to keep it at about 40 chars 
    regarding our mobile first approach. We try to place the CTA and the keywords at 
    the start of the title. Goal is not to have our title concatenated with "..." in
    search result snippets. On the other side, the title is important for the ranking 
    on other search engines than Google, which allow title tags to be longer as 60
    characters. If there is no suitable way to place the keywords into the 40 chars
    at the beginning of the title tag, then we aim at placing it as early as possible
    to make sure that the tag still makes any sense at all.

    These are the SEO Search Engine Optimization guidelines we try to keep up to when
    defining the title tag:

    1. Keyword placement

        We try to place the most important keywords with whom we want to be ranked 
        high in the search results in the title tag. We try to place it as early as 
        possible with regard to the fact that the tag still needs to make sense. The 
        tag may not be abused as a list of keywords. It must be our slogan and lead 
        our customers to our site. Keywords in title tags that the user has searched 
        for will get boldened by search engines, what has a positive effect on the 
        user, rendering a good CTR Click Through Rate for our sites.

    2. Legibility

        While it is intriguing to place as many keywords into the title tag as possible,
        we want to make sure, that we have a title that makes a real sentence and leads 
        the customer to click and bring him to our site.

    3. Fullfillment of the search term with the page main heading

        We want to give the customers the feeling of having found exactly what they 
        searched for. This means that our landing page for the search result should match 
        the search terms as close as possible. We try to achieve this with the main page 
        as well as with any sub pages.

    4. Include brand, company or site name in the title tag

        We want to make sure, that our brand, our company name or the name of the project
        is part of the title tag. If these terms are not a part of the keywords we want
        to be ranked high in search results, then we add them to the end of the title 
        tag, separated by a hyphen.

    5. Include a CTA Call To Action and triggers in the title tag

        Terms like "Buy now", "Order here", or "Downlaod for free" can help to lead customers
        to our site. We use square brackets to emphasize CTA's in the title tag. Terms like
        "Free", "Download", "View", "Buy", "Book" "Get Help" in combination with the term 
        "now" can help to trigger the customer to click the link to our site on the result
        page of the search engine he is on.
    
    6. Include chronological information in the title tag
    
        If the content of the site is sensitive for being actual, like in "Top 10 tools [2022]",
        or "Best restaurants in Zurich [2022]", we try to include the year or month in the title
        tag in square brackets to emphasize the actuality of the site data.
    
    7. Include geolocational or regional information in the title tag

        If the content of the site is sensible for being relevant to location, we try to include
        localizational information in square brackets into the title tag. -->

    <!-- Default SEO meta tag section

    See https://www.vioma.de/de/wiki/online-marketing/seo/meta-tags/ 
    (in German) for more information

    The following tag "description" is important for CTR but less important 
    for SEO Ranking. Try to keep it at about 100 characters because this is 
    the max amount of data that will be available on mobile viewports. 
    SearchEngines are not always paying attention to this tag. They might 
    decide to use other parts of the page to display in their search results.  --> 
    
    <meta name="description" content="OUR 100 CHARACTERS DESCRIPTION GOES HERE" />

    <!-- The following tag "keywords" is mostly ignored today. Google does not 
    display these keywords on its search results. The only advantage for our 
    customers is, that they may find our site easier, if they search inside their 
    bookmarks for these terms. -->
    
    <meta name="keywords" content="OUR KEYWORDS GO HERE" />

    <!-- The following tag "robots" is used to lead crawlers, robots and search 
    engines to behave as close to the way we want them to. It may only contain well 
    known terms which may be separated by commas. We should keep in mind that using 
    'content="noindex"' needs to be used with caution, because Google will treat sites
    that use this entry likewise as if they have 'content="nofollow"'. This might cost 
    us linkpower (linkjuice). Nonetheless we can use it on login-pages, the shopping
    cart or pages with search results. Since about 2019 there are new directives available.
    With 'content=max-snippet:[100]"' we can instruct the robots to display not more than 
    the number of characters defined inside the brackets. This can help to have a consistent 
    display of the description, but it also might have negative influence on it, if the 
    search engine is using its own description instead of the one we defined with the 
    description tag. We try to not use this, if not strictly necessary. The directive 
    'content="max-video-preview:[30]"' instructs the search engine to reduce the length of 
    video previews in the search results to the amount of seconds defined inside the brackets.
    The last of the new directives we care about is 'content=max-image-preview:[standard]'. 
    This lets us tell the search engine how to display images when they appear in search 
    results. 'none' would instruct them to not display images at all and this is no option 
    for us. With 'standard' we should be good, may be trying to use 'large' on wider 
    viewports. -->
    
    <meta name="robots" content="OUR ROBOTS TAGS GO HERE" />



    <!-- FACEBOOK OGP meta tag section

    See https://www.vioma.de/de/wiki/online-marketing/seo/meta-tags/ 
    (in German) for more information
        
    The next family of meta tags are the ones for social media sharing. We concentrate 
    most on Facebook's Open Graph Protocol (OGP) meta tags and on the Twitter meta 
    tags. The OG meta tags are pretty important, because they are used by some other 
    big platforms like XING, LinkedIn and Reddit to display search results on their sites.
    
    The tag 'property="og:title" content="YOUR SITE CONTENT GOES HERE"' defines under 
    which title our site is displayed in links shared on Facebook and other platforms 
    using OGP. We try to keep this rather short but descriptive. -->

    <meta property="og:title" content="OUR SITE TITLE GOES HERE" />

    <!--The tag 'property="og:image" content="LINK TO YOUR PICTURE"' defines which 
    preview picture is displayed. This is very relevant to us because it is the main 
    point of attraction in a linked page on Facebook. The ratio of the picture should 
    match the 1.91:1 aspect and have a resolution of at least 600x314px. We use a 
    resolution of 1800x942px. -->

    <meta property="og:image" content="LINK TO YOUR PICTURE GOES HERE" />

    <!--The tag 'property="og:type" content="website"' defines the type of content that 
    is displayed. For us the content type website is most relevant. There are other types 
    that might be set. See https://ogp.me/#types for more information. -->

    <meta property="og:type" content="website" /> 
    
    <!--The tag 'property="og:url" content="YOUR URL GOES HERE"' defines the exact URL 
    that will be displayed and linked on Facebook. This should normally be the original
    URL. Facebook is caching this URL, so it will have lesser impact on the traffic on 
    our site. -->

    <meta property="og:url" content="OUR URL GOES HERE" />

    <!--The tag 'property="og:site_name" content="OUR BRANDNAME OR DOMAIN GOES HERE"' 
    defines the tag that Facebook is displaying along with the Title and the description 
    of the linked page. It is kind of the short name of the URL eg OURNAME.COM or 
    OURBRANDNAME as a single entry. -->

    <meta property="og:site_name" content="OURBRANDNAME GOES HERE" />

    <!--The tag 'property="og:description" content="OUR SHORT DESCRIPTION GOES HERE"' defines 
    the same as the meta tag "description" above but may be longer than the standard tag 
    "description" because Facebook handles this by itself. We will always try to have this 
    value consistent with the one we use as standard "description", but may alter it for marketing 
    reasons to have a little more words to display our goals or content on social media links. -->

    <meta property="og:description" content="OUR SHORT DESCRIPTION GOES HERE" />



    <!-- TWITTER meta tag section

    See https://www.vioma.de/de/wiki/online-marketing/seo/meta-tags/ 
    (in German) for more information
        
    In this section we handle the way our linked pages are displayed in tweets and on Twitter. 
    Twitter uses so called cards to display linked sites. -->
    
    <!-- The tag 'name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image"' defines what content 
    lies behind the link Twitter displays inside a tweet. For websites we use either "summary" 
    or even better "summary_large_image". There are other content types like "app" for applications 
    or "player" for videos that could be used appropriately. -->

    <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />

    <!-- The tag 'name="twitter:title" content="SEO optimized title description goes here"' defines 
    what Twitter will show in BOLD letters as description inside of linked sites in a tweet. 
    We try to be consistent with out main title tag in the header section of the page. Can be 
    altered to have more reaction or as CTA. -->

    <meta name="twitter:title" content="SEO optimized title description goes here" />

    <!-- The tag 'name="twitter:description" content="SEO optimized site description goes here"' 
    defines what Twitter will show in REGULAR letters as description inside of linked sites in 
    a tweet. We try to be consistent with out main description tag in the header section of the 
    page. Can be altered to have more reaction or as CTA. -->

    <meta name="twitter:description" content="SEO optimized site description goes here" />

    <!-- The tag 'name="twitter:image" content="LINK TO YOUR PICTURE GOES HERE"' sets the path 
    to the image Twitter uses to display when linking to a site inside a tweet. Very important 
    because it is the eyecatcher for the users. Should be between 144x144px minimal and 4096x4096px
    maximal. Can not be bigger than 5MB and schould be at a ratio of 1.91:1. We use 1600x838 as 
    our standard for these pictures. -->

    <meta name="twitter:image" content="LINK TO YOUR PICTURE GOES HERE" />

    <!-- The tag 'name="twitter:site" content="@OUR-TWITTER-ACCOUNT GOES HERE"' sets the path 
    our Twitter profile. Used by Twitter to connect the linked site to our Twitter account. -->

    <meta name="twitter:site" content="@OUR-TWITTER-ACCOUNT GOES HERE" /> 

    <!-- The tag 'name="twitter:creator" content="@OUR-TWITTER-CREATOR-ACCOUNT GOES HERE"' sets 
    the path the Twitter account that created the tweet. Used by Twitter to connect the linked 
    site to the Twitter account of the person that created the tweet. -->

    <meta name="twitter:site" content="@OUR-TWITTER-CREATOR-ACCOUNT GOES HERE" />
